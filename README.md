## How to use this

_TODO link to final slides from_ https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/end-world-we-know-it-aka-your-last-nullpointerexception-1b-bugs

_TODO document required additional Eclipse plugins.. incl. https://github.com/jbosstools/m2e-jdt-compiler plus forked/re-merged (?) https://github.com/sylvainlaurent/eclipse-external-annotations _

This makes Enable Annotation-based Null analysis set up in Eclipse Project Preferences enabled from a Maven IDE (M2E) Configurator.



## Contribute

This project aims to develop an active community of contributors, and not remain controlled by a single person.  Anyone making 3 intelligent contributions to this repo may ask to be promoted from a contributor to a committer with full write access by opening an issue requesting it.  (We reserve the right to re-remove committers in exceptional circumstances, and after long periods of inactivity.)


## Future

If this is found to be of general interest, perhaps this could move to eclipse.org.  If this happens, it would be imperative to keep it very easy for anyone to contribute via Pull Requests on GitHub (and not, or not you only, eclipse.org Gerrit changes).
